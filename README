This is telnetcat, version 0.0.0
telnet scrape base

General idea
============

Telnetcat connects to a telnet server and renders the received data to an
off-screen buffer.  Whenever that buffer reaches a steady state for a
user-selectable timespan, it is dumped to stdout.  User input provided
on standard input is handed back to the telnet server.

This is supposed to facilitate screen-scraping of telnet connections.


Internal Data flow
==================

(from user) --> userinput.c --> core (telnetcat.c) <--> telnet.c <--> (server)
